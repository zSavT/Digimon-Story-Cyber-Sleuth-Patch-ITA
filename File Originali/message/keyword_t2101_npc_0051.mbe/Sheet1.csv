300000,4054,"","Oh, you there. Something troubling you?
I've got a minute, so tell me your problem.","喔，那邊那一位，你好像有什麼煩惱？
我現在正好很閒，就聽你說說吧。","","오, 거기 당신. 무슨 고민이라도?
난 마침 한가하거든. 들어주지.","Ach, du. Hast du Sorgen?
Ich habe Zeit, also erzähle mir davon."
300001,4054,"","...Hmm, that Kabuterimon's in a pickle.
If he was told to become the strongest,
his owner must really love to battle.","嗯……比多獸啊。
既然會說「成為最強的數碼寶貝吧」這種話，
那表示它主人一定是個戰鬥派的駭客了。","","……흐응, 캅테리몬이 말이지.
""최강의 디지몬을 목표하자""라는걸 보면
그 주인이라는 사람은 배틀파 해커겠군.","... Hm, Kabuterimon hat wirklich ein Problem.
Wenn er der Stärkste werden sollte, dann
kämpft seine Besitzerin wohl wirklich gern."
300002,4054,"","She probably worked hard to Digivolve him,
but he came out of it still looking kinda
weak... That must've been a big shock.","等到真的進化了，結果看起來卻沒那麼強，
所以它的主人很失望吧？","","모처럼 열심히 진화시켰더니 그다지 세보이지 않아서
충격을 받은거 아냐?","Sie hat sich angestrengt, um ihn digitieren zu
lassen, aber er sah immer noch schwach aus ...
Das muss ein Schock gewesen sein."
300003,4054,"","There's really only one thing to do:
Digivolve again and show how strong he can be!","這種時候當然只能這麼做！
那就是更加進化，讓主人見識更強大的自己！","","그럴땐 이것밖에 없잖아!
더욱 진화해서 더욱 강한 모습을 보여줄 수밖에 없지!","Da gibt es nur eins: Noch mal digitieren und ihr
zeigen, wie stark er sein kann!"
300004,4054,"","There's no need to thank me.
This was just a good way to kill time.","啊～不用謝我了。
我也只是剛好用來打發時間而已……","","아~ 감사는 하지 않아도 돼.
심심풀이로는 딱 좋았으니까…","Du musst mir nicht danken.
War doch ein netter Zeitvertreib für mich."
300005,4054,"","Arrrggh! I am so badass!","哇喔！！　我也太帥了吧！","","크으!! 난 역시 멋있어!","Arrrgh! Ich bin der Größte!"
300050,4054,"","I want a strong and cool Digimon!
Like a legendary, or something!","大家都會想要那種又強又帥、
彷彿「傳說中」般的數碼寶貝，你說對吧！","","전설의 디지몬! 같은
강하고 멋진 녀석을 갖고싶다~!","Ich will ein starkes und cooles Digimon!
Ein legendäres oder so was!"
