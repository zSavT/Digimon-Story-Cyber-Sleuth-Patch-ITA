140010,4741,"","Wonder if EDEN's gonna be okay...
First the old president, now the CEO...
The brass are dropping like flies.","EDEN不要緊嗎？
前社長跟現任CEO……連續兩位高層都下落不明耶。","","EDEN은 괜찮을까?
전 사장에 현 CEO에… 계속 톱이 사라지고 있네.","Ob mit EDEN wohl alles gutgeht ... Erst der
Präsident, jetzt die Geschäftsführerin ...
Die hohen Tiere fallen alle weg."
140020,4741,"","""Yuugo""... He's like an urban legend.
He's here but not... He's gone, but here.","「YUGO」嗎……他的存在已經是都市傳說的等級啦。
就像是「存在但是看不見、不存在但是看得見」那種感覺吧。","","""유고""인가 …존재 자체가 이미 도시전설이네.
있지만 없는, 없지만 있는. 이라는 느낌.","„Yuugo“ ist so was wie eine Großstadtlegende.
Er ist hier und doch nicht ... erst weg,
dann wieder da."
140021,4741,"","Turn around and he's suddenly behind you,
think he's there and realize you're alone.
Seems pretty ghostly to me.","一回頭人就在那裡，以為他人應該在，卻不見了……
那樣根本就是幽靈、鬼魂吧。","","돌아보면 있거나 있다고 생각했더니 없어지거나…
정말 유령이네. 고스트네.","Du drehst dich um und da ist er plötzlich.
Dann denkst du, er ist da, und bist alleine.
Genau wie ein Geist, wenn du mich fragst."
140022,4741,"","You'd think that'd be a bad thing, but his
ghostliness leaves an even stronger impression.
That's charisma. That's the mark of a real legend.","可是他的存在感卻一點都不薄弱呢。
不如說，那個像是幽靈的感覺反而給人帶來強烈的印象耶。
這就是所謂的超凡魅力、傳奇人物吧。","","그렇다고 존재감이 희미해지지도 않지.
오히려 유령같은 점이 강렬한 인상을 주잖아.
이거야말로 카리스마네. 레전드잖아.","Normal wäre das ja nicht so gut, aber er macht so
sogar noch mehr Eindruck. Er hat Charisma.
So erkennt man eine echte Legende."
140023,4741,"","His skill at hacking is also legendary. People
still talk about his punishment for the foreign
company that tried to take Kamishiro over.","他身為駭客的實力也是傳說級的哦。
之前某間國外大企業打算收購神代時，就是他出手給予制裁的。
那個事蹟鐵定會流傳千古啊。","","해커로서의 실력도 레전드 급이고 말이지.
어느 해외의 대기업이 카미시로를 인수하려 했을 때의 제재는
틀림없이 대대로 전승될거야.","Seine Hackerfähigkeiten sind auch legendär. Die
Leute reden immer noch davon, wie er die Firma
bestraft hat, die Kamishiro übernehmen wollte."
140024,4741,"","He used a Digimon program to get into the
company's server. Destroyed all their data.","畢竟他用數碼寶貝程式將那個大企業所有的伺服器，
以及所有的資料全部破壞殆盡耶。","","디지몬 프로그램을 써서 대기업의 서버란 서버
데이터란 데이터는 싹 파괴했으니까.","Er hat ein Digimon-Programm benutzt, um in ihren
Server zu kommen, und hat alle ihre Daten
vernichtet."
140025,4741,"","Come to think of it, he was really the one who
proved the power of Digimon programs to
hackers... That incident really redefined hacking.","說起來，就是那件事將數碼寶貝程式的強大性能
展現在駭客們的眼前，讓他們見識到新世代的駭客
該有的姿態呢。","","생각해보면 해커들이 디지몬 프로그램의 무시무시한
위력을 과시해서 차세대 해커의 모습을
알리게 된 사건이었지.","Jetzt, wo ich’s sage – er hat den Hackern
überhaupt erst die Macht der Digimon-Programme
gezeigt. Das hat Hacking neu definiert."
140030,4741,"","Not going to listen, huh.","你不想聽我說話對吧……","","내 이야기 안 듣고 있구나…","Du willst wohl nicht zuhören."
140040,4741,"","You know, I've never seen Yuugo myself...","順帶一提，我還沒有見過YUGO本人呢……","","참고로 나는 아직 유고를 본 적이 없지만…","Weißt du, persönlich habe ich Yuugo eigentlich
noch nie gesehen ..."
140050,4741,"","You know, I've never seen Yuugo myself...","順帶一提，我還沒有見過YUGO本人呢……","","참고로 나는 아직 유고를 본 적이 없지만…","Weißt du, persönlich habe ich Yuugo eigentlich
noch nie gesehen ..."
